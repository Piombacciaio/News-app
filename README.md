# News-app

Disclaimer:
- The original project for this android application is not mine, this is an edit of an already existing application
- API key found in the project may not work if too many requests are sent to the server. I suggest to change it; to create a new one go to https://newsapi.org/

the application is set by default to search italian news, to change this to another country you need to change country value in:
- techfragment.java
- sciencefragment.java
- mainfragment.java

The countries supported by used API can be found at: https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines
I'm going to change the horrid colors soon.
